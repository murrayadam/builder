## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No translation jobs found"**
- Ensure you have created translation jobs using the plugin
- Check that your API credentials are configured correctly

**"Unable to open Smartling"**
- Verify your Project ID is configured in plugin settings
- Ensure you have access to the Smartling project

**Real-time updates not working**
- Check browser console for SSE connection errors
- Verify webhook endpoints are accessible
- Confirm API key permissions

### Content Not Translating
- Ensure content is published (drafts cannot be translated)
- Check that text elements are not excluded from translation
- Verify target locales are configured in your Smartling project

## Migration from Legacy Version

If upgrading from a previous version that used local translation jobs:

1. **Existing Jobs**: Legacy local jobs will continue to work
2. **New Workflow**: Use "Send for Translation" for new content
3. **Job Management**: Access the new dashboard via "View All Translation Jobs"
4. **Direct Integration**: New jobs work directly with Smartling (no local job model)
